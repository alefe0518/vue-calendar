 So as it's called. This is a fullCalendar component based on vue.js . No Jquery or fullCalendar.js required. 
Currently, It only supports month view. I will use fc stands for vue-fullcalendar in following words.

Feel free to download it,re-develop it and use in your project.

### install

open your project and run this command.

```
  npm install vue-fullcalendar

### VUE-API

Since fc is a vue-based component. I pre-defined some properties.

#### VUE:props

fc will receive some props from outside world.

   1. events: Events will be displayed on the calendar
 ```javascript
events = [
{
title :  'event1',
start: '2016-07-01'ï¼Œ
YOUR_DATA : {}
},
{
title : 'event2',
start : '2016-07-02',
end : '2016-07-03',
YOUR_DATA : {}
}
]         
 ```

### VUE:events

When you do something, fc will dispatch some events out.

1. 'changeMonth' : Every time you click arrow to next/last month, fc will dispatch **changeMonth**

```
this.$dispatch('changeMonth', start, end)
```

**start** is the first day of current monthView

**end** is the last day of current monthView

2. 'eventClick' : Every time you click a event, fc will dispatch **eventClick**

```
this.$dispatch('eventClick', event, jsEvent, pos)
```

**event** is an Event object hold the event's information

**jsEvent** holds the native javascript event

**pos** is the relative coordinates of fc


3. 'dayClick' : fc dispatch it when you click a day slot.

```
 this.$dispatch('eventClick', day, jsEvent)
```

**day** is a Date Object of the day you click

**jsEvent** holds the native javascript event
